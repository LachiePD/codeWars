PARAMETERS:
An array with a variety of elements.

RETURNS:
The array, with any zeros moved to the end, preserving the original order of the other elements

EXAMPLE:

moveZeros([false,1,0,1,2,0,1,3,"a"]) // returns[false,1,1,2,1,3,"a",0,0]



PSEUDO CODE:


func moveZeros(arr) {

let answer =arr
loop through answer:

if ele === '0'
remove element.    -splice method?
put element at end of array -push method


return answer
}



THOUGHTS:
Need to use splice method, and either push or unshift method.
