 seems it will be helpful to find the difference between the amount of cans held in the largest level, and the rest of the levels.


 5 levels:

 5th level will have 5^2 = 25

 rest will have 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 5 + 25 = 30

 total of 55

 difference is 5.



 6 levels:

 6th level will have 6^2 = 36

 rest will have 30 + 25 = 55 (found from prev answer).

total of 81

 difference is 11.



 7 levels:

 7th = 7^2 = 49

 rest will have 55+36 = 91

 difference is 42
