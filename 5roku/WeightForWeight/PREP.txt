Parameters:
string of numbers

Returns:
string of numbers, ordered by 'weight'
'weight' is the sum of the digits that make up the number.
Example:
'6 11 42  99'
===> '2 6 42 99'


Psuedo Code:
can potentially convert all values to unicode character, then sort aphabetically, then convert back.

couldnt figure it out, heres the psuedo


function(input){

break input into array, called inputArr. This array holds objects of the original int, and the weight (yet to be found);


loop through inputArr:

for each ele in inputArr, break the original ele into seperate digits, then assign the weight prop to the sum of these digits. can probably use .reduce() here.




sort through the  inputArr, according to the now found 'weights'.

return a string, built from the original ints, that have now been sorted according to weights.
