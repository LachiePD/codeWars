my attempt worked, but wasnt efficient enough
my efficieny was different because it sorted every iteration, it is better to check if it needs sorting then sorting it.

Operating on something in place is more efficient, should be done if the array isnt needed elsewhere in the program.


Using a flag to note when a change occured is more efficient than checking the whole arrays sum every iteration.
