P=array of triplets, [['t','u','p'],
  ['w','h','i'],
  ['t','s','u'],
  ['a','t','s'],
  ['h','a','p'],
  ['t','i','s'],
  ['w','h','s']
  ]
R= a 'hidden' string, which is built from these triplets. Each char in the triplet, will appear before its following neighbour. 
e.g. above, w appears before h, h before i. t before s and so on.

E=array above will return  'whatisup';
